# Flag-Asean-Guess
Game Flag Asean Guess on IOS

This application is an iOS game designed to guess 10 flags from countries in ASEAN. Initially, the name of a country will appear randomly, and you have to guess it from a choice of flag images from the 10 ASEAN countries. 

This is the initially preview :

Users must guess the flag corresponding to the displayed country name by clicking on one of the flag images. Whether the guess is right or wrong, the game proceeds to the next round where another country name is randomly displayed, but it shouldn't be a duplicate from the previous rounds. This continues until 10 guesses have been made. After the 10th guess, an alert will pop up informing that the game has ended and indicating how many guesses were correct. An option will appear: "Play Again", which resets the game allowing the user to play again, or "I'm done, too tired", which will close the application and return to the home screen.

This is the alert when the game end :
